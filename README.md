# M.A.A.S.V
This is a prototype for a machinery, which will help people with motor and vision impairments.
The machinery will be made from recycled parts of other objects (mainly from broken technological parts), helping nature and the environment.

It's a project which I'll maybe be financial helped on the future by the scholl, Escola Stagium.
But is open for outside financial help, on the condition that leave to the original owners take care of the creation of the prototype.

M.A.A.S.V is an acronym in portuguse for: Maquinário Automatico de Ajuda à Seres Vivos

Project accompanied by the teacher Paula Guolo.
And started September 2022 by Artur Kleindinst Luz on Escola Stagium.

The project cannot be used by others without the creator's permission and without due credit.
